          <h1 class="colorA">About the Daily Bruin and Bruinwalk.com Referendum</h2>

          <p>The Daily Bruin and Bruinwalk.com are asking the UCLA student body to support a $3 fee increase that would keep our important campus services running for years to come. UCLA&rsquo;s student-run media, including the Daily Bruin and Bruinwalk, have for decades relied on sales of printed advertisements in the Daily Bruin to support ourselves &ndash; we don&rsquo;t receive funding from USAC, and we&rsquo;re independent from UCLA. Now, as more students use our services on the Internet rather than in print, the Daily Bruin and Bruinwalk.com need additional support from the student body to keep running in the future. Without this referendum, the futures of UCLA&rsquo;s 97-year-old daily newspaper, its go-to professor review website, UCLA Radio and seven community newsmagazines are in danger. We&rsquo;re asking for this referendum to allow for the continued publication of our products, which aim to train journalists and developers while informing, entertaining, educating and improving life on campus. The referendum seeks to add $3 to quarterly undergraduate student fees starting in Fall 2016 to fund the activities of the UCLA Communications Board, the publisher of the Daily Bruin and Bruinwalk.com. The $3 sum will be tied to inflation based on the Los Angeles County Consumer Price Index (CPI) to meet future rising costs and allow us to never again ask for funding from the student body. </p>
